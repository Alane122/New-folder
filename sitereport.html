			<h1>CSY1018 - Web Development</h1>
			<h2> </h2>
			<p>This webpage is very simple as I have little knowledge of html and CSS. overall, i enjoyed learning and actually make my own css. there was many ups and downs but I managed to produce something. I started by trying to get a responsive menu navigation. I found it easy to create links and turning it into buttons by adding hover effects.  I chose the colours of the webpage based on my preference. What I found more challenging making the webpage work correctly on mobile or desktop browser without many disruptions to the basic layout.</p>

			<h2> </h2>
			<p>The hamburger icon was added so that the menu navigation will disappear when decreasing the size of the page and appear when the user clicks the icon. I configured it to look like a dropdown menu. The negative I have is not knowing how to keep the layout tidy when page size is decreased.</p>

			<h1>CSY1018 - Web Development</h1>
			<h2> </h2>
			<p>I took the knowledge I gathered in lectures and applied it to my work. This was handy as I could check back at work we did and use it to improve my webpage. I did struggle at times making me start everything again. But I found out later about commit and branches. If I knew about it before I would have had more commits from the start of the webpage and branches would have meant praticing on a copy instead of the master. </p>
